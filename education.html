        <h1>Financial Investments</h1>

        <h2>Stocks</h2>
        <p>Buying shares of a company means owning a portion of that business. Stocks generally offer higher returns over time compared to other investments but come with volatility.</p>
    
        <h2>Bonds</h2>
        <p>Bonds are debt securities where investors lend money to governments or corporations in exchange for interest payments. They provide stability and predictable returns.</p>
    
        <h2>Mutual Funds</h2>
        <p>Mutual funds pool money from multiple investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other assets. They offer professional management but come with management fees.</p>
    
        <h2>Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)</h2>
        <p>ETFs are similar to mutual funds but trade like stocks on an exchange. They provide diversification and often have lower fees.</p>
    
        <h2>Commodities</h2>
        <p>Investing in raw materials like gold, oil, or agricultural products can serve as a hedge against inflation.</p>

        <h2>Options Trading</h2>
        <p>
        Options are financial derivatives that give investors the right, but usually not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a given price within a specific time frame. 
        They are commonly used for stock and market speculation, hedging risk, and generating fast income with low capital.
        </p>
    
        <h3>Call Option</h3>
        <p>
        A call option gives the holder the right to buy an asset at a specified price before the expiration date. 
        Investors buy call options when they expect the price of the asset to go down.
        </p>
    
        <h3>Put Option</h3>
        <p>A put option is like the opposite of a call option, and it gives the holder the right to sell an asset at a specified price before the expiration date. 
          Investors buy put options when they expect the price of the asset to go down.
